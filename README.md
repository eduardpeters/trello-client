# Trello Client

This project was developed as a group effort during the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at The Bridge. 
It emphasized working with an API (the Trello API) to create a React App that would interact with our boards.
Overall, it reproduces a few of the basic functionalities one could find in the actual Trello web client.

## Features
  - Login through the Trello Authorization page
  - Displays all available boards
  - Displays the lists and cards from the selected board
  - Lists: Create, Rename, Move (via button or Drag and Drop), Archive
  - Cards: Create, Rename, Move (via button or Drag and Drop), Archive and Delete
  - Card Information: Suports description, dates, checklists, comments, members.

### Usage

Clone the repository, `cd` into it and run `npm install` to add the project's dependencies. The project setup requires you to create a `.env` file that contains the app address and a Trello Client API Key generated in Trello to identify the client. The actual user token will be generated by the authorization pages at start. Running `npm start` will allow you to enjoy our project!
